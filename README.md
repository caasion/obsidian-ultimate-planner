## About The Project

![Ultimate Planner Screen Shot][product-screenshot]

The Ultimate Planner is an [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) plugin to make long-term planning much simpler. Instead of being stuck with rigid todo lists, you can plan what to do for each action item (i.e. a course or a fitness goal) over the long-term.

I've started to document my development of this plugin! Please see [devlog]!

### Built With

## Rationale
I've found that planning on a day-to-day basis is often too restricting. After all, you can't always do everything in one day. Google Calendar is great for long-term planning, but it also isn't specific enough. There is too much clutter if you were to put down all your task in Google Calendar. After all, it is moreso for events.

I designed and developed this plugin as a hybrid between the two, which allows you to simutaneously plan a task across multiple days but also plan from day to day.

The advantage of the table format is two fold:

Looking down through a column allows you to see your tasks/plans for a day.

At the same time, it is conducive to long-term planning as you can plan what to do for one action item individually across columns. (An action item is a way to group together tasks based on a common objective that it contributes to, i.e. school, fitness, or family).
![Ultimate Planner Row][row]

I don't intend this calendar format to replace daily planning or google calendar--rather, I want it to act as a bridge between the two, which is why I am working on daily notes integration and google calendar integration. Please see [roadmap]!

## My Design Touches
I designed the plugin to be a flexible planner, knowing that goals and objectives change over time. There are many features to add, remove, extend action items as time goes on.

I also implemented some QoL features to make the planner more user friendly:
- Tab and shift-tab navigation
- Rename and change color of action items
- Easy date navigation through weeks
