Today, I'm going to do a sprint to finish up the plugin into a shippable state. Here's the plan:
- Implement the rest of the features
- Try out plugin (from installation)
- Fix bugs if needed
- Ship.
- Write out README.md, add demo to personal website

Summary:
- [Fix bug] The table is no longer reactive once I go too far back in time.
- [Feature] Add Template ✔️ 327b3a4
- [Feature] Remove Item
- [Feature] Remove Template
- [Feature] Collapsible Cells
- [Feature] Float Cell (for unscheduled tasks)
- [Feature] Calendar Features
    - Fetch on creation
    - Button to fetch calendar on command
    - Fix settings options to curate fetching
- [Feature] (Low Priority) Drag and drop in templates editor.
- [Feature] Sortable views (i.e. isolate one action item across time)

## Debugging
After implementing the add template feature, the whole table broke. I think it's a problem with reactivity, but I'm going to debug this so it doesn't cause future problems.

Update: A problem occurs when I add a new template and go back. Ultimate Planner doesn't seem to understand that a change has occurred with the templates and it's time to render things differently. however, the curious thing is that all the datas are processed correctly, but it is just a reactivity that is lacking.
Furthermore, after a reload, The table works fine. However, it is during the transition between the templates that causes bugs.
