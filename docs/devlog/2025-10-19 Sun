I've been quite inconsistent with my development logs, so I'd like to provide a brief update.

In the past few days, I've been working on the dependency injection refactor. Why? I was sick and tired of having to change all of my imports and implementations everytime I modified a function or the way of how something works. I hated refactoring, and that was the only thing I was doing--instead of actually developing and making something new or productive.

I stumbled upon dependency injection, which turns the responsibility of the imports to `main.ts` instead of every file, so I've been refactoring to implement that. I know I said I hated refactoring, but I think implementing dependency injection will definitely make working with this code base a lot easier.

I'm still in the process of implementing it, but I've been learning a lot about dependency injection by doing. I hope to write about what I've learnt soon.

I've just finished refactoring and injecting dependencies to my ultimate planner view. However, I've decided to not continue with DI for now because I want to Think about how I want to implement the view rendering in the data processing first, then I can devise the functions that I might need, then I can inject the dependencies that I will need.

## Brainstorming
Here is the result of some brainstorming I did:

I also made a sample data set to help visualize:
[sample data](<sample data 2025-10-19.json>)

## Procedure to Render Table
- We have an anchor date.
- Depending on the settings `weekFormat`
    - if true, we will get the dates from the start of the week to the end of the week, multiplied by the number of weeks (blocks) to render
    - if false, we will get X of dates from anchor
Okay, I'm doing this graphically. I want to properly define what I mean by blocks, columns, etc.

![Rendering Logic](<rendering logic 2025-10-19.png>)

It is so much quicker to have the rendering logic figured out because I can directly focus on implementing the code instead of thinking while coding. 

Also, dependency injection is paying off! I am able to define a function in the interface and not have to worry about implementing it. I love that the interface is like a contract saying "I will implement it," but I don't have to implement it RIGHT NOW.

One problem I've found with my new rendering system is that I cannot properly get the items since they don't have any order, and my rows are based on numbers. I will need to add an ordering to my item list.
