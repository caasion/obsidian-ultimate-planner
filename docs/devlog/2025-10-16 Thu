Problems to solve:
- If I don't ensure that everything has the same row numbers, the table rendering will be really weird... I need to have blank cells.


I temporarily made context menu be a void function so I don't have to worry about implementing it yet.

?!?!?!?!?!??! This is so annoying. I'm just trying to get my new data structure working, but you're telling me I have to fix everything else? I don't have the capacity for that. I need to work on the current feature I have on hand first. This is very frustrating.

Is it the way I'm coding? Is it the way this whole thing works? This isn't the first time I've had this problem, and it takes away so much time from development because I'm just putting flex tape all over leaking buckets everywhere.

Okay dependency injection?? Or maybe object-oriented programming...

Okay, I'm on commit 60506b2 right now, and I've just finished my first dependency injection implementation. I converted all of my functions into "services." I've also create a CalendarPipeline class. The combination of the two allows me to delegate all the import statements to main.ts, where I create the class on runtime.

Tomorrow, I'm going to refactor planner actions to use the new services.
