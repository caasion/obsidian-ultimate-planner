I couldn't finish what I was doing yesterday, so I just continued where I left off. It's quite late, so I can probably only finish this refactor.

## Cont of (B) Break `plannerStore` into smaller stores
...
- Now the annoying job is to incorporate these functions throughout my codebase.
- I committed the changes in 115a99e.
- However, I realize that I need to do some rigorous app testing to make sure the refactoring hasn't broken anything or made anything do something unintended. I need to test:
    - Edit Action Item
    - Extend
    - Remove
    - Move Up/Move Down
    - Add new action item
- But before that, I had to fix `main.ts` to use the new stores (a996ef6). I also had to fix UPV's references (631ab3c).
- Most importantly, I caught a critial data persistence error (I forgot to initialize from `data.json`), and fixed it (f86db11).
- That's it for today. I'm going to test tomorrow.
