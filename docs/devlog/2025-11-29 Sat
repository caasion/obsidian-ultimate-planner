## Float Cells
Today, I finished the implementation of float cells. The main issues I addressed were UI/rendering issues with float cells.

The logic was mostly there already.

## Daily Notes Integration
My personal workflow calls for a greater coupling of daily notes and the ultimate planner.I illustrated a PDF document to show what I am envisioning.

[Ultimate Planner v2](<Ultimate Planner v2.pdf>)

Things to consider:
- The plugin will only store templates, which look for information in certain daily notes. It no longer stores the daily information
- Each action item will have an option to have a float cell. Not all action items need a float cell
