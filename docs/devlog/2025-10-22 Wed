I spent a few minutes fleshing out how I want the templates editor to look like and whether if I want to have template editing features within the context menu. Here is what I've come up with:

![Template Editor Brainstorm](<2025-10-22 templates brainstorm>)

I ended up creating a whole UI for my templates editor, fixing some implementations, and adding the contacts menu and edit item option back to UPV. Creating a templates editor was a lot easier because I had it planned out in the beginning.

Next Steps:
- stuff from yesterday
- Adding a drag and drop library to my templates editor.

Instead of making things look pretty imperfect, I'm going to focus on implementing features and optimizing the app. I wasn't planning on working on this app for a little more, but I really want to get the basics down so I can start focusing on other projects that really showcase my skills.

I'm going to start by fixing the UI because right now the rows are out of sync. I have been talking to chat GPT to find a solution that will work, so I'll see how it goes.
